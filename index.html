          <p class="description">
            I transferred to Virginia Tech my junior year of college after transferring twice already, so trust me I know how tell a good school from a bad one!  Some of the things I love most about Virginia Tech are the people, the Blacksburg community, and all my professors!</p>

          <p class="description">
            One of my passions outside of school is makeup, so when I got to Virginia Tech I wanted to join a club that would allow me to express myself creatively in this way.  I joined Spark because the organization's goal is to provide creatives with an outlet and with opportunities to foster their creative abilities.

          <p class="description">
            Before I transferred, I started off as a Computer Science major because I really enjoy coding.  However, when I transferred to Virginia Tech, I wanted to pursue a more well-rounded major.  I decided to change my major to Business Information Technology, which is a marriage of Computer Science and Business Information Technology.</p>

          <p class="description">
            As I mentioned earlier, one of my passions is makeup, so I have an Instagram account that I love to post my makeup looks on.  I also love watching anime, profesisonal basketball, and YouTube videos in my free time. On top of all of that, I also enjoy reading books, a lot.  Currently, I am reading a book about mental health and alternatives to medicine to improving it.</p>
